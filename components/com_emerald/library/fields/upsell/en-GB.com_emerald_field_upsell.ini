X_BASICRULE="This is default rule that is applied to any extension without special rule adapter installed. Principe is simple. First you have to turn off SEF so you could see native URL parameters. let's say you have URL <code>index.php?option=com_docman&view=categories&catid=10</code>. Then first <i>URL Parameter</i> would be <code>view</code> and <i>Parameter value</i> would be <code>categories</code>. This will protect from accessing any list of the categories. And if you want only specific categories enter second Parameter/Value as <code>id</code> and <code>10</code>. Or you can list few IDs separated by coma <code>10,12,15</code> or range <code>10-15</code> or mix <code>10,12,15-25,67</code>. "
